# Spring Data Batch Processing

Minimal [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) sample app.

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)
- [Gradle 6 or higher](https://gradle.org/install/)

## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method
in the `com.example.SpringDataBatchApplication` class from your IDE. Alternatively you can use
the [Spring Boot Gradle plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins.html#build-tool-plugins.gradle)
like so:

```shell
gradle bootRun
```
